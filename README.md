# Convex_Hull
Creation of a convex hull and study of it.

# The program is divided into 3 parts:

- The first part concerns the creation of the point cloud and the creation of an associated polygon, notably through an algorithm for sorting in trigonometric order.

- The second part contains an algorithm for creating the convex hull of a list and uses the first part to create the convex hull of the point cloud.

- The third part contains an algorithm that determines the diameter of the previously found convex hull.

Hoping you enjoy the program
